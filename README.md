Hello My Name is Jon,
I'm 59 YO (well it is a dating site for project romances) and though I'm not new to world of electronics, I'm way behind. I'm into Family, (there I said it) cars and motorcycles. I love to fix and customize them (Cars and Motorcycles). I have an old 1993 Honda ST1100 That I am customizing with paint, fairng mods and adding lights for effect. I bought on Amazon the UNO R3 Super starter kit from Elegoo and a string of WS2811 IP65 LED's. So my desire is to place the lights in a fashion that will give the effect of plasma being created through copper springs. Basically a light that starts from 2 outside points to a center point. So like 7 lights that fire to the center light. The next one is kind've like the flux capacitor as I want lights to come from the center of the air cleaner out to the edges in a spiral like a plasma chamber or fusion device. I want the frequency to be controlled by the tach signal. If I can add pics I will.

I have breifly gone through some tutorials but they always seem to miss something for an ADHD suffering, Math illiterate, what the hell kinda guy like me. So if some of you cool smart dudes feel like helping me out, I would greatly appreciate it.
